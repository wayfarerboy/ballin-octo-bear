    "description": "Rodents, particularly Black Rats, are very agile climbers. They can reach the comfort of the attic with ease, running up and down stucco walls, climbing cable lines or guttering.  Black Rats can enter the attic through the smallest hole, making it larger as they gnaw.  Squeaking, scratching or rustling noises coming from your attic are often the first sign that you have an infestation.  If not controlled, rodents can cause serious damage in the attic, including house fires if they chew through electric cabling and will return year after year to make your attic their home.</p><p>Click on a hotspot (<span class=hotspot>+</span>) to identify attic rodents and the different types of damange they can cause in the attic.",
